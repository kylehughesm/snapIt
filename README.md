# Old School Project Refactored

This is my project from school I decided to refactor to adhere to Clean Code rules
It may still need a litte work, but the database and the routes are now separted into their own interfaces

# Steps I use

    git clone

    uv sync

Then to run: 

    uv run gunicorn run:app

*Database has to be manually setup and web application won't fully function without a database.
